- Login system with username and password.
- Limits incorrect login attempts.
- Validates email format and checks for university-specific domains.
- Random student ID generation.
- Written with beginner-friendly C++ concepts (loops, conditionals, strings).

📚 Technologies Used:
- Language: C++
- Standard Libraries: `<iostream>`, `<string>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<ctime>`

🧑‍💻 Purpose:
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice real-world programming logic using C++. It’s a great starting point for beginners who want to build login systems or school-related applications.

🚀 How to Run:
1. Download the `.cpp` file.
2. Compile with a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
